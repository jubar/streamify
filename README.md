## üì¶ Installation

1.  Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jubar/streamify.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory: cd streamify
3.  Install dependencies: npm install

You can now start the server in development mode. Since this is a demo project, and to make execution easier, the `.env` file and a copy of the database are provided. The local database can be found at `/prisma/dev.db`.
<br/><br/>
If you want to re-create the DB you need to execute the following commands:

```bash
$ npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

then in order to populate the DB, execute:

```bash
$ npx prisma db seed
```

> üëÜ This command will take 30 seconds, depending on the machine, to complete because it creates 30k records in the database.

<br /><br />

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Start the application in dev mode

Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open a browser with the following URL http://localhost:3000 and you should see something like this:

<br />

## üêô Run tests

To run the tests, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

A report of the test status will appear directly in the terminal.

## Run E2E tests

We don‚Äôt have a dedicated testing environment or database, so we‚Äôll use the development server. Playwright is configured to automatically start the server if it‚Äôs not already running.

To run E2E tests, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ npx playwright test
```

A report of the test status will appear directly in the terminal.

<br/> 
If you prefer to run the E2E tests in UI mode execute the following command:

```bash
$ npx playwright test --ui
```

and you can see the test player like this:
